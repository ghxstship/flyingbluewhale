# GVTEWAY Portal (/p/[slug])

Inventory of every `page.tsx` under `src/app/(portal)/`. The portal is the `(portal)` shell (`data-platform="gvteway"`, blue). Routes live under `/p/[slug]/...` where `slug` is the project + authorization boundary; one static sibling page lives at `/p/select`.

Per-persona portals are organized as a tile-grid root page plus sub-routes. Almost all surfaces are **read-only** (RLS-scoped lists, status badges, metric cards) — the production team authors in `/console`, the portal displays. The interactive exceptions are concentrated in **Client** (proposal sign/decide/lifecycle), **Artist advancing** (deliverable submit + state machine), **Privacy panels** (DSAR/export), **Messages** (AM chat), and the shared **the deskless-workforce suite surfaces** (feed/kudos/docs reused in crew + vendor). Many crew/vendor pages link out to the COMPVSS `/m` shell for the actual create action (e.g. time-off, docs upload, requests).

Conventions used below: `<PortalDocVault>` = read-only deliverables table (file-centric doc-specs, no download control). `<PortalPrivacyPanel>` = DSAR list + consent ledger + data-export/erasure request links. the deskless-workforce suite `*Surface` = shared components reused from the COMPVSS PWA.
