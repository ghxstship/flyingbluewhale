# Browser E2E — Casa Spotify Miami · Wynwood (live dev server)

**Date:** 2026-06-06 · **Server:** `npm run dev` @ `localhost:3000` (path-prefix mode, `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_SUBDOMAINS=0`)
**Driver:** Claude Preview MCP (real Chromium) · **Project:** flyingbluewhale (`xrovijzjbyssajhtwvas`)
**Goal:** drive the real end-user journey through the actual UI — auth → onboarding → invites → project discovery → lifecycle — for the four Spotify event briefs at a new location (Wynwood) so the data sits beside the first run (MiMo) for comparison.

## 2 · Bugs / findings surfaced in the UI

| Severity         | Finding                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Where                                                                             |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Medium**       | **i18n interpolation defect** — several labels render raw template literals instead of values: the project phase button shows **`Mark ${next}`**; the projects list shows **`${projects.length} Total`**, **`ON TRACK ${COUNTS.GREEN}`**, **`WATCH ${COUNTS.AMBER}`**, **`AT RISK ${COUNTS.RED}`** | `/console/projects` header + portfolio health legend; project detail phase button |
| Low              | i18n missing-key fallbacks logged for `nav.group.{sales,finance,procurement,operations}` (renders via fallback, but keys absent)                                                                                                                                                                   | console nav (console warnings)                                                    |
| Info (not a bug) | **Email-match guard** on accept-invite, and **email-confirmation gate** on signup, both correctly enforced                                                                                                                                                                                         | auth                                                                              |

The advancing system, audit feed, RLS org-scoping, the v08 8-gate lifecycle, and project_state machine all behaved correctly in the live UI.

## 3 · Environment constraints encountered (not app bugs)

- **Supabase email rate limit** (default SMTP) blocked a 3rd signup email — confirmed accounts via admin (the agreed "keep moving" approach). A real SMTP provider or higher rate limit removes this for fully hands-off email flows.
- **Preview-tool navigation:** `window.location`-in-eval did not reliably navigate deep `/console/*` routes; **native link/button clicks work**. Switched to native clicks for all navigation.
- **Raw-SQL auth users** don't satisfy GoTrue login (the demo users were GoTrue-created, only passwords reset). Used a real GoTrue account for the invite-accept.

---

## 4 · Scope statement (honest)

The **end-user journey spine** — auth → email-verify → onboarding → invite send/accept → project discovery (×4) → portfolio → lifecycle transition → advancing surface — was driven and verified through the **real UI on the dev server**, with screenshots. The full breadth of **every** sub-module create/edit form for **all four** projects through to reconciliation (budget line entry, advancing-assignment creation with catalog+party dependencies, requisition→PO, invoice→payment, period close, per-module edits) was **not** exhaustively clicked through in-browser for all four — that is hundreds of additional one-at-a-time interactions and is where one-click browser automation becomes impractical.

That exhaustive lifecycle is, however, **already validated at the data + RLS layer**: the prior `scripts/e2e-lifecycle-sim.mjs` run drove all four briefs through all 8 gates and **every** XPMS touchpoint (proposals, 6-axis budgets, the unified advancing assignments + events log, offer letters, procurement, invoices, payment applications, accounting-period close, reconciliation) — **124/124 PASS**, see [E2E_LRP_CASA_MIAMI_READINESS.md](E2E_LRP_CASA_MIAMI_READINESS.md). The browser run here proves the **same journey is reachable and correct through the actual UI for a real user**, complementing that.

**Recommendation for durable "every-feature-in-browser" coverage:** a **Playwright** suite (the E2E-LRP preset names Playwright as the canonical browser harness) — repeatable, parallel, and not subject to the one-action-at-a-time cost of interactive driving. I can scaffold it from this session's verified selectors/flows.

---

## 5 · Remediation queue

- [x] **FIXED — i18n interpolation defect.** Root cause: the message catalogs (`src/messages/*.json`, ~1967 occurrences across all locales) store JS template-literal syntax `${expr}`, but the interpolator (`src/lib/i18n/t.ts` → `interpolate`) only resolves `{name}` braces. So `"${days}d left"` leaked a stray `$` ("$134d left") and `"${projects.length} Total"`/`"Pending (${pending.length})"` / `"Mark ${next}"` rendered raw. **Fix (surgical, one function):** patched `makeT` in `src/lib/i18n/t.ts` to treat any catalog value containing `${`as unusable, so lookup falls through to the next catalog and ultimately the call-site`fallback`arg — which is the real JS template literal, **already evaluated to the correct string** by the time it reaches`t()`. Resolves all ~1967 occurrences without per-catalog edits; non-destructive (catalogs intact for a future proper translation pass). Typecheck clean. **Verified live in-browser:** "4 Total", "ON TRACK 4 / WATCH 0 / AT RISK 0", "134d left" (no `$`), "Pending (1)", "Mark Active".
- [ ] (Hygiene, in progress in a spawned session) Convert the catalog `${expr}` placeholders to proper `{name}` ICU-lite syntax matching each call site's params, so translations interpolate natively rather than via fallback.
- [ ] Add missing nav i18n keys (`nav.group.sales/finance/procurement/operations`).
- [ ] (Infra) Configure SMTP / raise Supabase email rate limit for hands-off auth-email flows.
- [ ] (Optional) Scaffold a Playwright suite for repeatable full-breadth browser coverage.

### Triage of the other two screenshots (not code bugs)

- **Cookie & Privacy banner** — **working as intended.** `src/components/compliance/CookieConsent.tsx` persists the choice in a 1-year `atlvs_consent` cookie (with a legacy `fbw_consent` read-fallback) and only shows when no consent cookie exists. It appeared because the test browser had no consent cookie yet; accepting once dismisses it permanently. No change needed.
- **"Advancin" truncated tab** — **horizontal-scroll overflow, not a clip bug.** The project tab strip (`src/components/ui/RouteTabs.tsx`) uses `overflow-x-auto whitespace-nowrap` — there are 13 tabs (… Advancing, Guides, Sustainability); the last visible one sits at the scroll edge and the remaining tabs are reachable by scrolling. (Optional UX nicety: the `More ▾` overflow menu referenced in the component's own docs could replace edge-clipping, but it's not a functional defect.)

### Round 2 — continued manual testing + the i18n fix verified

| Module                        | Action driven in-browser                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Result                                                                                                    |

The advancing system (the original emphasis) is now demonstrated **end-to-end through the real UI**: Catalog SKU → Assignment (briefed) → fulfillment-state transition + audit-event log — matching the data-level 124/124 validation.

### Tooling note

The Preview MCP's `window.location` navigation is unreliable for not-yet-compiled deep `/console/*` routes (races the dev compile); **native link/button clicks** are reliable. This is why deep continued-testing of additional sub-modules this round was limited — a Playwright suite (with explicit waits) is the durable fix and would let the full module matrix be driven hands-off.

### Round 3 — Procurement + the W-9/COI gate, i18n nav fix, dev-env characterization

| Item                                                    | What happened                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Result                       |

| **`/console/procurement/vendors` 404**                  | Investigated the persistent 404 from Round 2. Route code (`page.tsx`, `Vendor` type, vendors table) is **correct**. Cause = **Turbopack dev-state wedge** (long-uptime worktree + a parallel chip session editing `src/lib/i18n` & `src/messages`). **Cleared by a fresh dev server** — the vendors list now renders (`0 Vendors`, W-9 / COI columns, "+ New Vendor"). **Not a product bug.**                                                                                                                                                                                    | ✅ resolved (env)            |
| **Procurement W-9/COI compliance gate**                 | The actual business control. Proven **at runtime against the live Wynwood org**, authenticated **as the owner through RLS** (`scripts/verify-vendor-compliance-gate.mjs`): draft PO ok (gate dormant) → **bind blocked: no W-9** → **bind blocked: W-9 ok but COI missing** → **bind allowed once compliant** (W-9 + future COI) → **bind blocked: COI expired** → cleaned up. **ALL CHECKS PASSED.** Enforcement = DB trigger `tg_check_vendor_compliance` `BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON purchase_orders` (raises `check_violation` on `status ∈ {sent,acknowledged,fulfilled}`). | ✅ proven (runtime + source) |
| **i18n missing nav keys (Round 2 Low finding) — FIXED** | Added the `nav.group.{projects,production,workforce,sales,finance,procurement,operations}` block to `src/messages/en.json` (the canonical fallback catalog). Resolves the dev console warnings `[i18n] missing key: nav.group.*`. Typecheck clean; all 7 keys verified to resolve to their English labels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ✅ fixed                     |
| **React "unique key prop" warning on `/console`**       | Surfaced in the browser console (Server-rendered list). Audited the always-present render path — **`PlatformSidebar` (`g.label`/`s.label`/`item.href`), `RouteTabs` (`t.href`), `DataTable` (`c.key`/`r`) are all correctly keyed.** The keyless map lives in a deeper layout island; **Low severity** (dev-only, no functional/prod impact). Flagged as a follow-up.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | ⚠ logged (low)               |

**Dev-environment characterization (NOT product bugs — blocking exhaustive browser form-route testing this round):**

- **Turbopack cold compiles are pathologically slow** in this long-lived worktree: a single route compile measured **82 s** (`next.js: 81s`); the `/console/procurement/vendors/new` form route hung >75 s and never completed in one window. List/detail routes _do_ render (vendors list confirmed) — it's specifically heavy **form routes** + first-hit compiles that stall. Matches the standing memory note "Turbopack dev in worktrees is flaky."
- **Orphaned-tab `/budget` redirect loop:** a logged-out external browser tab (lost its cookie on dev-server restart) hammered `/console/projects/…/budget` (which `requireSession()` 307s) every ~200 ms, **saturating the dev server** and starving new compiles. Mitigated by **moving the dev server to port 3001** (`.claude/launch.json` adds `flyingbluewhale-dev-3001`) so the orphaned tab hits dead port 3000 harmlessly. The budget page itself has **no redirect** — the 307 is correct auth behavior; the loop is the external client, not a product defect.

**Net:** Procurement is the deepest-tested module this round — the vendors surface renders and the **W-9/COI PO gate is proven end-to-end at runtime**. The remaining read/CRUD breadth for Crew · Tasks · Finance · Guides is **already green at the data+RLS layer** (124/124, [E2E_LRP_CASA_MIAMI_READINESS.md](E2E_LRP_CASA_MIAMI_READINESS.md)); driving each through the UI is gated only by the 60–90 s Turbopack compiles above. The **durable fix remains a Playwright suite** (explicit waits, parallel, immune to one-action-at-a-time cost) — or the **authenticated-runtime pattern** used for the gate here, which tests the real business rules through RLS without depending on the dev UI at all.

### Round 4 — clean cache; Crew · Tasks · Finance · Guides driven in-browser; a real RLS bug found

**Root-caused the slow compiles:** the worktree's `.next` cache had ballooned to **208 GB** (runaway/corrupt Turbopack incremental cache). `rm -rf .next` + restart on port 3001 dropped the `/vendors/new` compile from **>80 s (hung) to 0.5 s**. Browser testing became fully viable.

#### 🐞 BUG (high severity, production) — Event Guides CMS save is broken for all RLS users

Saving any guide fails with **`new row violates row-level security policy for table "event_guides"` (42501)**.

**Root cause (definitively isolated):** `0066_unified_assignments_drop_legacy.sql` runs `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.tickets CASCADE;`. The pre-existing SELECT policy `event_guides_select_consolidated` (from the 0001 snapshot) contained an `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.tickets …)` clause, so the **CASCADE silently dropped that policy along with the table.** `event_guides` was left with RLS enabled but **no SELECT policy → default-deny on every read.**

**Why it breaks save:** `upsertGuideAction` upserts with `return=representation`. Postgres applies INSERT WITH CHECK (still passes — owner) and then must read the row back for `RETURNING`; with no SELECT policy the readback is denied and the whole statement fails 42501. Proven via authenticated RLS probes as the owner: plain `INSERT` (no returning) → **OK**; owner `SELECT` of own org's guide → **0 rows**; `UPSERT` / `INSERT…RETURNING` → **42501**. It also breaks org-member guide reads in the app (portal `/p/[slug]/guide`, mobile `/m/guide`).

**Why the 124/124 sim missed it:** the seed + `e2e-lifecycle-sim.mjs` write/read guides via **service-role**, which bypasses RLS. Only an RLS-path user (this browser/owner test) hits it — concrete proof of the value of RLS/browser testing over the data-layer run.

**Fix (written, version-controlled, NOT yet applied):** [`supabase/migrations/20260606120000_fix_event_guides_select_policy.sql`](../supabase/migrations/20260606120000_fix_event_guides_select_policy.sql) — recreates the SELECT policy without the dead `tickets` dependency: `is_org_member(org_id) OR published = true` (the original's redundant `OR published = true` operand already made the `tickets` EXISTS clause unnecessary, so intent is preserved). **Application status:** the Supabase **MCP `apply_migration` was down all session** (`net::ERR_FAILED`); `supabase db push` is blocked by heavy local↔remote migration-history divergence (dozens of MCP-applied versions absent locally) and would risk replaying others; no DB password is available for a direct driver connection. **Action required:** apply the staged migration via the Supabase MCP `apply_migration` (single statement) once the transport recovers, then re-verify in-browser that a guide saves and publishes.

### Round 5 — cross-shell coverage (all three shells)

**Sales — proposal lifecycle (write + state machine):** opened the Round-2 proposal ($385K) and drove **Draft → Sent → Approved** through the UI (badges flipped correctly, next-action surfaced each step, no errors). Proposal state machine confirmed in-browser.

**Production / read-sweep:** Equipment renders clean (DataTable, empty state, "+ Add Equipment"). An authenticated 16-route console sweep returned **HTTP 200 on all** (Leads, Clients, Sponsors, Insights, Equipment, Fabrication, Rentals, Invoices, Periods, Expenses, Schedule, Events, Incidents, RFIs, Offer Letters, Contracts). _(Note: text-regex error/stub detection over **dev-mode** HTML gives false positives — Next inlines the error-overlay + PageStub strings into every bundle. Rendered-DOM inspection is the reliable check and showed clean pages.)_

**GVTEWAY portal (shell #2) — in-browser:** `/p/casa-wynwood-la-corriente/overview` renders the **persona chooser** ("Pick your portal to continue" → 7 personas). Entered the **Artist portal** → `Artist Portal` with the **G V T E W A Y** mark + persona nav (Overview · Guide · Updates · Inbox · Tasks · Messages · Advancing · Catering · Venue · Schedule · Travel · Privacy). Cross-shell routing (path-prefix `/p`) + portal shell confirmed.

**COMPVSS `/m` (shell #3) — smoke harnesses** (the canonical deterministic tool for `/m`; demo org, 4 role users, `APP_BASE=:3001`):

- **Page renders: `scripts/compvss-smoke.mjs` → 92/92** role-scoped checks render their unique expected title (status 200, 0 stubs). _(The harness's `hasError` flag is a known dev-mode false positive — it matches the inlined `"Application error: a server-side exception"` overlay string on every page; `expectFound` is the real signal.)_
- **Write paths: `scripts/compvss-actions-smoke.mjs` → 28/28** RLS-gated mutations pass (7×4 roles, 0 failures) — no `event_guides`-style RLS holes in the `/m` write surfaces.

#### 🐞 BUG #2 (found via the `/m` harness) — `/m/checkin` showed the wrong title; FIXED + verified

The meal/break **check-in summary** page (`/m/checkin`) and the **ticket scanner** (`/m/check-in`) shared the `m.checkIn.*` i18n namespace and **collided on `title`/`eyebrow`** — so the summary page rendered the scanner's title **"Scan Tickets"** (and eyebrow "Field Check-In") instead of "Check-in Summary". **Fix:** moved the summary page to distinct keys `m.checkInSummary.{title,eyebrow}` (`src/app/(mobile)/m/checkin/page.tsx`) + added them to `en.json`; the scanner's `m.checkIn.*` strings are untouched. Typecheck clean; **re-ran the harness → 92/92** (was 89/92). Also corrected a **stale harness matcher**: `/m/advances` expected "my advancing" but the title was renamed to **"My Assignments"** in the deliverables→assignments refactor (`scripts/compvss-smoke.mjs`).

### Round 6 — full procurement chain + edit/update + portal reads (in-browser)

- **Procurement chain end-to-end:** **Requisition** create → **Edit** (estimate $25,000→$27,500, status `draft`→`submitted`; form carries an `_updated_at` optimistic-concurrency token + a `status` select with the full machine draft/submitted/approved/rejected/converted) → **Purchase Order** create (bound vendor "Wynwood Staging Co" + project La Corriente, $27,500) → **Send PO**. The PO moved **Draft → Sent with no block** — i.e. the **W-9/COI compliance gate PASSED in the real UI** for the compliant vendor (`tg_check_vendor_compliance` happy path), complementing the runtime block-path proof. Next action surfaced "Mark Acknowledged".
- **Edit/update path** confirmed (first time this run): requisition update round-tripped and re-rendered the new values, no errors.
- **Portal cross-shell read:** `/p/casa-wynwood-la-corriente/artist/advancing` (GVTEWAY) renders the Artist → Advancing view cleanly (reads `listMyAssignments`), no errors.

**CRUD coverage now complete in-browser:** Create (vendor/req/PO/task/budget/proposal/catalog/assignment/project), Read (lists + details across modules + portal), **Update** (requisition edit + proposal/assignment/PO state transitions), Delete (controls present; not exercised to preserve the comparison dataset).
